# front-end-dev-test

Samuel Tweedy  |  2/8/2023

## Instructions

For this project I used the provided dev server and Node 14.16.1, which I managed with nvm.

Commands to run the build locally:

<pre>
  nvm use 14.16.1
  npm install
  npm start
</pre>

### *Please also submit a small write up discussing (leave answers to a sentence or two):*

  What technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

  1. The technologies I used are those that were provided because I chose to challenge myself by adapting to the given technology, which include webpack, html, scss, js, and bootstrap. I also used svg-url-loader and file-loader to allow the technology to read svg and jpg files. Lastly, I used swiperjs for the carousel, google fonts for styling, and fontawesome for icons that were not provided (the stars for the review rating).

  Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

  2. One struggle I faced was learning webpack because I have never interfaced with the technology before and had to learn how to modify webpack.config.js to properly read the svg and jpg files. The second struggle I faced was hosting the project on Heroku or GitPages because the build process would hang indefinitely. I exhausted all the methods I have used in the past (including attempting to update the technology) and was unable to deliver a solution despite continous research on the topic. I know that Rooster Grin has an exceptional team of developers and if I were in a similar situation while working on your team, after exhausting all my knowledge and research, I would consult with the member or members of my team that are experienced in this aspect of the technology to deliver a succesful result and to aquire the tools I need to solve the problem independtily in the future.

  What you enjoyed the most and why

  3. The most enjoyable aspect of the project was creating the aniamtions because nothing brings life to a website quite like how animations do. I chose to add a timed loop to the carosel to add a little more activity to the page and I ensured the loop was properly timed so it would not be too distracting or too slow. Adding animations to the icons was also fun, I chose to apply a simple animation on hover that both scales the icon as well as introduces a very subtle shadow to make it pop.

  *What I would do differenly

  4. In the beginning of the project, especially because I used technology that is not up to date and involved unfamiliar tech, I should have attempted to host the app on the preffered hosting service before designing the app. By doing this, I would have recognized the hosting issue in the beginning and could have switched to a library I'm familiar with, such as ReactJS.

  Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon!




## Intro

Congratulations on making it to the testing phase of the hiring process! For this part, we would like to learn about your creativity, how well you code, and how well you follow instructions.

You will need to have knowledge of some key things before you start:
  - how to run a local server
  - how to connect your markup to your scripts and styles
  - front end web development

We have supplied an optional development server and some development dependencies for this project, but feel free to use the development framework of your choice (e.g. create-react-app, vue cli, etc). You are not required to use the codebase provided in this repository, but feel free to use it! If you choose to use this codebase, you can run the development server using the commands found below:

<pre>
  npm install
  npm start
</pre>

<em>NOTE: You will need node and npm on your machine if you choose to use the supplied server, also for hosting you will need to set it up yourself.</em>
